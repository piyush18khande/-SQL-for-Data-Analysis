## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
- Download from: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### 2. Create Database
  createdb employee_db
psql -d employee_db -U postgres

CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id   SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name    TEXT,
  last_name     TEXT,
  department    TEXT,
  salary        NUMERIC(10,2),

\copy employees
(employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, joining_date) 
FROM 'full/path/to/employees.csv'
CSV HEADER;

### 5. Run Queries
SQL Queries Implemented
a) Basic SELECT / WHERE / ORDER BY
Filter employees by department
Top N highest-paid employees
Employees joined after a specific year

b) Aggregates & GROUP BY
Average salary
Total salary per department
Count of employees per department

c) JOINS (with departments table)
INNER JOIN (employees + department info)
LEFT JOIN (all employees, even if no department info)
RIGHT JOIN (all departments, even if no employees)

d) Subqueries
Employees earning above department average
Average salary per department

e) Views & Materialized Views

mv_avg_salary_by_dept materialized view

f) Window Functions
Rank employees by salary within department
Running salary total by joining date
Salary percentile across all employees
